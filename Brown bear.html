            The brown bear, also known as the grizzly bear in North America is one of the larges terrestrial members of the order Carnivora that still lives today.
            It is only rivaled in size by it's close relative, the polar bear, whom is on average a bit larger in size. The brown bear is also the most variable in size of the modern bears.
            This is in most part thanks to sexual dimorphism. On average, a male brown bear in most subtypes are 30% larger than it's female counterpart.
            The brown bear belongs to the Ursus family and its scientific name is Ursus arctos.

            As the name implies, the brown bear is brown. However, the brown bear comes in many different shades.
            In India, brown bears come in a reddish coloration with white tips, and in China the brown bear has been observed to have a bicolored coloration.
            Often will the chinese brown bear have a yellowish-brown to a whitish collar across their necks.
            In North America the coloration of the brown bear usually leans towards a darker shade of brown and some are so dark they can be mistaken to be black from a distance.
            This grizzled dark brown coloration is why in North America the brown bear is known as the grizzly bear.

        <p>As a large majority of bears, the brown bear is an omnivore.
            Saying that the brown bear is an omnivorous animal might be an understatement as the brown bear has observed consuming the largest variety of food.
            Contrary to common belief, the brown bear consumes very little meat. Its diet is compromised of 90% vegetable matter.
